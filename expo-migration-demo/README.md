## API Configuration

Your backend API URL needs to be configured in:

Change this line:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://your-api-url.com/api/analyze', {
```

To your actual API endpoint.

## Key Differences from Web Version

| **Camera** | `react-webcam` | `expo-image-picker` (simpler!) |
| **Storage** | `localStorage` | `AsyncStorage` |
| **Navigation** | `wouter` | `@react-navigation/stack` |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | StyleSheet |
| **Components** | `<Button>` | `<TouchableOpacity>` |
